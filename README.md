# Power Consumption Monitor

This is a very basic example on how to observe the power consumption 
using a CloudFree Smart Plug device.

# Setup

Best way to set this up is to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```
$ poetry install

$ poetry run jupyter notebook
```
